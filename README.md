Getting Started:
To get started with the movie recommendation system, you need to have a basic understanding of the project's architecture, data schema, and system usage. This readme file provides an overview of these aspects of the project.

Prerequisites:
Before installing dependencies for the movie recommendation system, make sure your system has the following prerequisites:

Python 3.x
Pip package manager
Relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL

Database Schema:
The database schema for the movie recommendation system consists of three tables:
User Data Table: This table stores information about each user in the system, such as their username, password, email address, and any other relevant demographic or preference data.
Watch History Table: This table stores information about which movies each user has watched and rated in the system. It includes columns for the user ID, movie ID, and rating given by the user for each movie.
Movie Data Table: This table stores information about all the movies in the system, including features such as budget, genre, runtime, cast, and release date. It includes columns for each feature of the movies, and each row represents a single movie.
Usage:
To use the movie recommendation system, users will be required to create an account and provide some basic demographic and preference data. Once registered, they can browse and search for movies, watch movies, rate movies, and receive personalized recommendations based on their viewing history and preferences.

Algorithm Overview:
The movie recommendation system uses a combination of content-based and collaborative filtering algorithms to provide personalized recommendations to users. Content-based filtering is used to identify movies that are similar to the ones a user has previously watched and rated highly. Collaborative filtering is used to identify movies that other users with similar viewing habits have enjoyed and rated highly.

Conclusion:
The movie recommendation system provides a comprehensive and personalized movie recommendation service to users based on their viewing history and preferences. The system is built using a combination of machine learning algorithms, data analysis techniques, and database management. The system's architecture and data schema enable it to make more accurate and personalized movie recommendations to users.
